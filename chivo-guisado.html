                        In my case, I was listening to a podcast in the middle of the workday hosted by two men, both from the Caribbean and, between impassioned tirades about the potential of the New York Knicks, commisserated on their shared experience as the children of stern,
                        accented immigrants. Children of fathers with feet like cinderblocks and four smiles distributed across the entire latter half of their life. Children of mothers with a love so deep that its incompatible with any kind of distance.
                        He mentions chivo guisado: a beautiful, luxurious dish that takes skill and, more importantly, a sense of purpose. You have a debit card and a trader joe's on your commute home.

                        I’m not sure how long or when this vegetable amalgamation should remain in the pan. I’ve seen my mother do this hundreds, maybe thousands of times, but I haven’t seen my mother cook for several years. Sometimes she calls me and in the long pauses I can
                        hear a faint sizzle that could be the <em>sofrito</em> in a pan behind her. It is more likely an artifact of the phone connection.</div>

                        Keep an eye on these because remember, these tomatoes have more of a backbone than you do. If they persist, smash them as best you can with a wooden spoon. Again, stay focused! You will miss your target often!
